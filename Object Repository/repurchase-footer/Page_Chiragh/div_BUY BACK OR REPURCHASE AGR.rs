              BUY BACK OR REPURCHASE AGREEMENT
              Chiragh Project Document : September 2018
              
                A buyback or repurchase agreement (also known as a repo) is a sale of a property asset coupled with
                an agreement to repurchase the property asset at a specified price on a later date
              
              
                It is similar to a secured loan-the cash lender loans cash to a borrower and receives the
                  borrower's securities as collateral.
                The repo or buyback agreement is widely used by investors around the world, it is popular due to
                  the secure, collateralized nature of the transaction, coupled with flexibility of liquidity and
                  collateral, repos provide an efficient solution, pairing conservative short-term lenders with
                  borrowers in need of short -term financing . The difference between the amount of cash loaned and
                  the value of the collateral posted is called the &quot;haircut&quot; or the &quot;margin.&quot;
                Each transaction is secured with property collateral that is worth more than the notional amount,
                  acting as a buffer for the lender against short ­ term variations in the collateral ' s value.
                Chiragh Platform acts as the mediator between the borrower and the investor. The investor has
                  funds that he is willing to lend and the repo borrower has property asset to post as collateral for
                  the loan
                To the borrower, repos offer liquidity maximization, principal protection , and a competitive
                  market return. To the repo dealer, the transactions are a major source of short -term funding. The
                  tri-party agent provides operational services, valuation of collateral, and optimization tools to
                  allocate collateral efficiently .l The mechanics of tri-party repo are explained later in this
                  document
